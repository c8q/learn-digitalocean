## Why?

Because AWS is so last week.

(No, seriously, have you ever tried asking AWS support a question?
  Unless you are paying them tens of thousands of dollars a month

  their ticket system to be forgotten... DigitalOcean not only
  have a great platform, they have a great set of resources and
  a team of people on Twitter ready to answer any question.)

#### Real Reasons:
