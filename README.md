DigitalOcean-Setup
==================

Quick guide to getting a DigitalOcean account and launching your first app.

## Why?

Because AWS is so last week.

(No, seriously, have you ever tried asking AWS support a question?
  Unless you are paying them tens of thousands of dollars a month
  and have a "support agreement" your questions just go into
  their ticket system to be forgotten... DigitalOcean not only
  have a great platform, they have a great set of resources and
  a team of people on Twitter ready to answer any question.)

#### Real Reasons:

- A **simpler** way to deploy your apps/websites.
- **Great performance**
- ***Cheaper*** than AWS, Rackspace, etc. ([*transparent pricing*](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/))
